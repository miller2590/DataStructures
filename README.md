# Python Data Structures

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Python.

## Structure

The repository is divided into several folders, each focusing on a specific topic:

- [LinkedList](LinkedList/linkedList.py): This folder contains an implementation of a linked list in Python.
- [DoublyLinkedList](LinkedList/doubleyLinkedList.py): This folder contains an implementation of a doubly linked list in Python.
- [PythonArraysAndStrings](PythonArraysAndStrings): This folder contains Python scripts demonstrating operations on arrays and strings. It includes:
  - [mergeSortedArrays.py](PythonArraysAndStrings/mergeSortedArrays.py): A script to merge two sorted arrays.
  - [reverseString.py](PythonArraysAndStrings/reverseString.py): A script to reverse a string.
- [PythonHashTable](PythonHashTable/hashTable.py): This folder contains an implementation of a hash table in Python.

## Usage

To run any script, navigate to its directory and run the Python file. For example:

```bash
cd LinkedList
python linkedList.py
```
